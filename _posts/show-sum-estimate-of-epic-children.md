## Introduction
It can be useful to see how much effort is required for an Epic based on it's children but while the functionality to see a sum total is available to some extent for Stories and Tasks, this is not the case for Epics. 

This post shows you how to track scope for an Epic and its children and show that data in dashboard. Definitely useful for reporting!
